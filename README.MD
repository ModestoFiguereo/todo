## Requirements

In order to run this project in you local environment you will need:

- (REQUIRED) [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- (REQUIRED) [Docker compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)
- (REQUIRED) [Dnsmasq](https://wiki.debian.org/HowTo/dnsmasq) / Acrylic DNS Proxy (Windows)
- (OPTIONAL) [Socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html)

#### Dnsmasq (Unix) / Acrylic dns proxy (Windows)

(@TODO: write the doc for configuring Acrylic on windows.)

Configure it depending of your OS so you can access Kong API Gateway when send a html/rest request to todo.loc or `*.todo.loc` where `*` is whatever fit subdomain [RFC rules](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035)

#### Setup Dnsmasq on Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
echo 'address=/.todo.loc/127.0.0.1' > /etc/dnsmasq.d/todo-inf
sudo service dnsmasq restart
```

#### Setup Dnsmasq on OSX

```bash
brew install dnsmasq
cd $(brew --prefix)
mkdir etc
echo 'address=/.todo.loc/127.0.0.1' > etc/dnsmasq.conf
sudo cp -v $(brew --prefix dnsmasq)/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
sudo mkdir /etc/resolver
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolver/loc'
```

## Running the system

(@TODO: write the equivalent .bat scripts for windows.)

- `./startup.sh` **JUST THE FIRST TIME** this script will set everything up for you and run the system.
- `./start.sh` this script allow to run the system starting all containers for you.
- `./stop.sh` this script stop the system.
